## Frame 1 — Text can't be tapped

- scene: an agent's plain-text reply types into the void, then greys out under one mono verdict
- duration: 8s
- transition_in: cut
- src: compositions/frames/01-text-cant-be-tapped.html
- status: outline
- type: hook
- persuasion: Pain agitation
- beat: friction → recognition
- blueprint: typewriter-reveal (Adapt)
- focal: authored — the typed agent reply
- roles: (no captured assets — typography-only beat)
- asset_candidates:
- cue: 0.0 "Flight AA 2417 is delayed 40 minutes." (types) · 2.6 "You can rebook, change seats, or add a bag." (types) · 5.0 "Text can't be tapped." (lands) · 6.4 hold
- sfx: typing, key-press
- handoff_out: caret — x 50% (frame centre), y 62% of canvas, scale 1.0, opacity 1, blinking, stationary; it is the ONE element that survives the cut into Frame 2.

narrativeRole: Open on the everyday failure the protocol exists to fix, in the viewer's own language —
an agent that can answer you but can't hand you anything to use.
keyMessage: An answer is not an interface.

Adapt: keep typewriter-reveal's signature — a live caret typing a line as a human would, then the
line collapsing into a payoff. Changed: the payoff is not a brand pop but a verdict line, because the
brand belongs to Frame 2; and the collapse is a **desaturation**, not a clear, so the dead text stays
visible under the verdict as the evidence for it.

Scene 1 (0.0–2.6s): void + grid-field only. A single `stream` caret sits centre-left at ~38% width,
62% height, and the agent's first reply **types on with the caret** (`discrete-text-sequence` +
`context-sensitive-cursor`) in body ink — one line, ~34 characters of measure. Nothing else exists.
Centred single-column, ~46% of frame, 2 depth layers (grid behind, type in front).
Scene 2 (2.6–5.0s): the caret continues to a second line on its cue — same type-on, same rail. The
two lines now read as a plausible agent reply and nothing more. No camera move.
Scene 3 (5.0–6.4s): on the cue, both lines **desaturate to `ink-faint` in one 0.4s pass** while a
mono `kicker-index` verdict lands directly beneath them via **per-word staggered reveal**
(`dynamic-content-sequencing`), the word "tapped" carrying a single `asr-keyword-glow` hit in `live`
— the frame's one voltage moment. Hierarchy by contrast + weight; the dead reply drops to background,
the verdict owns the frame.
Scene 4 (6.4–8.0s): held read. Everything still; only the caret blinks. No drift, no push.

# ASR Keyword Glow

Words in a phrase visually activate (glow blur + scale) when "spoken", following an attack-sustain-release envelope over per-word `{ start, end }` timestamps. In a real ASR pipeline the timings come from a word-level transcript (`hyperframes transcribe` — same shape); for promo video, hand-author them to control emphasis pacing. The envelope never falls to zero after a word — it decays to a rest level, leaving a breadcrumb of recent emphasis.

## How It Works

A single linear driver tween (`ease: "none"` — any other ease distorts the per-word envelope; do not change) sweeps scene time; its `onUpdate` loops over ALL words computing each one's envelope: 0 before `start`, linear attack to 1 over `ATTACK_DUR`, sustain at 1 until `end`, decay to `REST_LEVEL` over `RELEASE`, then hold at rest. The envelope drives `text-shadow` blur and `scale` — one driver for the whole phrase, never one tween per word (60+ words would bloat the timeline).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="phrase">
  <span class="word" data-word="{w1Key}">{w1}</span>
  <span class="word" data-word="{w2Key}">{w2}</span>
  <!-- … the final word may be the brand, with the .brand modifier -->
  <span class="word brand" data-word="{brandKey}">{brandWord}</span>
</div>
```

```css
.phrase {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: center;
  color: {restColor};
}
.word {
  display: inline-block; /* required for transform on <span> */
  transform-origin: 50% 50%;
  text-shadow: 0 0 0 {glowColorTransparent};
}
.word.brand {
  color: {brandAccentColor};
}
```

```js
// Per-word spoken windows — one entry per span; brand word 1.5-2× a normal word's window.
const TIMINGS = {
  // {w1Key}: { start: …, end: … },  — seconds, local to the scene
};

function envelope(time, start, end) {
  if (time < start) return 0;
  if (time < end) return Math.min((time - start) / ATTACK_DUR, 1);
  const releaseEnd = end + RELEASE;
  if (time < releaseEnd) return 1 - ((time - end) / RELEASE) * (1 - REST_LEVEL);
  return REST_LEVEL;
}

const words = document.querySelectorAll(".word");
const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: SCENE_DURATION,
    duration: SCENE_DURATION,
    ease: "none", // linear — t maps 1:1 to scene time
    onUpdate: () => {
      words.forEach((el) => {
        const timing = TIMINGS[el.dataset.word];
        if (!timing) return;
        const env = envelope(driver.t, timing.start, timing.end);
        el.style.textShadow = `0 0 ${MAX_BLUR * env}px ${glowColorRgba(env)}`;
        el.style.transform = `scale(${1 + MAX_SCALE_BOOST * env})`;
      });
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

`glowColorRgba(env)` returns the glow color with `env`-modulated alpha.

## Variations

- **Karaoke style (RECOMMENDED for video narration)** — the default amplitudes read too subtle in video: inactive words still dominate. Render inactive words DIM and lerp the active word toward bright + larger; at any moment 1–2 words are bright (spoken + lingering rest) and the rest is dim. Use for short phrases (5–10 words) where one word at a time should POP; keep the subtle default for long dense text. Pushes MAX_BLUR, MAX_SCALE_BOOST, and REST↔ACTIVE contrast; everything else identical:

```js
function lerpChannel(a, b, t) {
  return Math.round(a + (b - a) * t);
}
function colorAt(env, isBrand) {
  const target = isBrand ? BRAND_RGB : ACTIVE_RGB;
  return `rgb(${lerpChannel(REST_RGB.r, target.r, env)}, ${lerpChannel(REST_RGB.g, target.g, env)}, ${lerpChannel(REST_RGB.b, target.b, env)})`;
}
// in onUpdate: el.style.color = colorAt(env, el.classList.contains("brand"));
```

- **Multi-octave glow** — multiply the sustain by `1 + sin(driver.t × PULSE_HZ) × PULSE_AMPLITUDE` so high-emphasis words breathe at peak.
- **Color shift on the peak** — same channel-lerp from `restColor` → `peakColor` as `env` rises (non-karaoke form).
- **3D pop-out** — add `translateZ(env × MAX_POP_Z)` so the spoken word leans toward camera; requires `perspective` on the parent.
- **From real ASR transcripts** — convert `{ word, start_ms, end_ms }` entries to seconds and feed in identically.

| SCENE_DURATION  | = `data-duration`    | same          | driver must end in sync with the scene's seek window       |

## Critical Constraints

- **Timings monotonic, non-overlapping** — every entry's `end` < the next entry's `start`; overlapping windows make the envelope ambiguous.
- **Brand word window 1.5–2× a normal word** — the brand is the headline; let it sustain.
- **Driver ease stays `"none"`** — any other ease warps every word's envelope timing.
- **`text-shadow`, not `box-shadow`** — the glow must hug the GLYPH (speaking emphasis), not the inline-block rectangle.
- **One driver looping all words** — never one tween per word.
- **Commit to a style** — values between the default and karaoke columns yield awkward "half-loud" emphasis.
- **Climax dwell ≥1s** after the final word's emphasis — the last word IS the headline beat.

# Context-Sensitive Cursor

In a typewriter sequence, the cursor's color (and optionally height / blink behavior) matches the **active text segment** — brand accent while typing the brand name, dim on placeholders, success color on the completion mark. The eye lands on the keyword being typed because the cursor shifts with it; a fixed single-color cursor is visual noise by comparison. Layers on top of [discrete-text-sequence](discrete-text-sequence.md)'s SEQUENCE pattern.

## How It Works

The text is authored as a SEQUENCE of `{ t, text, segment, color }` entries; a linear driver's `onUpdate` reverse-searches for the current entry and writes both the visible text and the cursor's `background` (the cursor is a colored block, so `background`, NOT `color`). A second linear tween sweeps a phase `p` through `2π × BLINK_CYCLES_PER_SCENE` and gates cursor opacity on `sin(p) > 0` — a deterministic square-wave blink on the timeline.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="prompt">$</div>
  <div class="text-wrap">
    <span class="text" id="text"></span><span class="cursor" id="cursor">_</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.terminal {
  font-family: {monoFont}; /* proportional fonts drift the cursor mid-segment */
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  white-space: pre; /* preserve trailing spaces — cursor sits at segment end */
}
.text {
  white-space: pre;
}
.cursor {
  display: inline-block; /* inline ignores width/height */
  width: {cursorWidth}px;
  height: {cursorHeight}px;
  background: {textColor}; /* default — overridden per segment in onUpdate */
  vertical-align: {cursorBaselineFix}px; /* small negative — anchor to baseline, not line-height */
}
```

```js
// Adjacent entries usually share a text prefix but may differ in `segment` —
// that's what shifts the cursor color mid-line.
const SEQUENCE = [
  { t: 0, text: "", segment: "main", color: "{mainColor}" },
  { t: T_LEADIN_END, text: "{leadInChunk}", segment: "main", color: "{mainColor}" },
  { t: T_BRAND_IN, text: "{leadInBrandPrefix}", segment: "brand", color: "{brandColor}" },
  { t: T_BRAND_OUT, text: "{leadInBrandFull}", segment: "main", color: "{mainColor}" },
  { t: T_CMD_IN, text: "{leadInCmdPrefix}", segment: "cmd", color: "{cmdColor}" },
  { t: T_SUCCESS, text: "{leadInDone}", segment: "success", color: "{successColor}" },
];

function entryAt(time) {
  for (let i = SEQUENCE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= SEQUENCE[i].t) return SEQUENCE[i];
  }
  return SEQUENCE[0];
}

const textEl = document.getElementById("text");
const cursorEl = document.getElementById("cursor");

const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: DURATION,
    duration: DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const entry = entryAt(driver.t);
      textEl.textContent = entry.text;
      cursorEl.style.background = entry.color;
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Deterministic square-wave blink
const blink = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  blink,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BLINK_CYCLES_PER_SCENE,
    duration: DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      cursorEl.style.opacity = Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Non-blinking during active typing** — suppress blink while letters are appearing (solid cursor), resume on idle. This MUST be a pure function of the driver's time: tracking a mutable `lastChangeTime` in `onUpdate` is not reverse-seek-safe (scrubbing backwards leaves the stale forward-pass value behind and the cursor blinks — or holds solid — at the wrong frames). Bake the change times from the SEQUENCE instead — every entry whose `text` differs from its predecessor is a typing event:

```js
// Baked once at build time — no runtime state.
const CHANGE_TIMES = SEQUENCE.filter((e, i) => i > 0 && e.text !== SEQUENCE[i - 1].text).map(
  (e) => e.t,
);
// In onUpdate — identical result at any seek, either direction:
const isTyping = CHANGE_TIMES.some((t) => t <= driver.t && driver.t - t < TYPING_GRACE);
cursorEl.style.opacity = isTyping ? "1" : Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
```

- **Cursor HEIGHT shifts on segment** — larger cursor on the brand segment: `cursorEl.style.height = entry.segment === "brand" ? cursorHeightEmphasis : cursorHeight` (1.1–1.25×; more reads as glitch).
- **Contrast reversal** — a dark-text-on-light segment needs a dark cursor too; keep `entry.color` as the single source of truth and read from it.

| BLINK_CYCLES_PER_SCENE | period ≈ 0.6–1.2s           | **whole number** — otherwise the sin sweep ends mid-cycle and the cursor pops on the last frame |
| TYPING_GRACE           | 0.15–0.3s                   | **< shortest dwell between adjacent entries** — otherwise the cursor never blinks               |

## Critical Constraints

- **Cursor color goes on `background`** — it's a colored block, not a glyph.
- **Blink is timeline-driven sin, pure of any mutable tracker** — the typing-grace variation shows the seek-safe form.
- **`white-space: pre` on text and container** — collapsed trailing spaces park the cursor in the wrong column.
- **Monospace font + `display: inline-block` cursor** — proportional faces drift the cursor mid-segment; inline ignores the block geometry.
- **BLINK_CYCLES_PER_SCENE is a whole number** for the fixed DURATION.

# Discrete Text Sequence

Instead of character-by-character typewriter, replace entire string states at time thresholds — enabling non-linear effects (typos, backspaces, bulk paste, "thinking" gaps) that smooth per-char typing can't achieve. If your effect is "type each character, no edits", this rule is overkill — use the smooth-slice variation below.

## How It Works

The typing is authored as a sparse array of `{ t, text }` states; on every `onUpdate` a **reverse search** finds the latest entry whose `t` has passed and renders its text. Display jumps between states with no animation between them — the realism comes from the schedule shape: fast keystroke clusters (0.06–0.20s apart), pauses at word breaks (0.3–0.6s), a typo, backspaces peeling back to the fork, then a bulk paste replacing many chars in one entry. A block cursor blinks via a deterministic sin square wave on the same timeline.

## Recipe

  align-items: baseline;

  width: CURSOR_WIDTH;
}
```

```js
// Each entry shows from its t until the NEXT entry's t.
// Shape: keystrokes → typo → backspace to the fork → bulk paste → completion mark.
const SEQUENCE = [
  { t: 0.0, text: "" },
  { t: T_K1, text: "{p1}" }, // first keystrokes (~3-5 chars, 0.1-0.2s apart)
  { t: T_K2, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_typo}" }, // continuation containing a typo
  { t: T_BS, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_partial}" }, // backspace(s) — peel back to the fork
  { t: T_BULK, text: "{fullCorrectedText}" }, // bulk paste — many chars in one jump
  { t: T_DONE, text: "{fullCorrectedText + ' ✓'}" }, // completion marker
];

// Reverse-search for the latest entry whose t has passed
function textAt(time) {
  for (let i = SEQUENCE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= SEQUENCE[i].t) return SEQUENCE[i].text;
  }
  return "";
}

const textEl = document.getElementById("text");
const cursorEl = document.getElementById("cursor");

const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = textAt(driver.t);
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Cursor blink — deterministic sin square wave, never a CSS animation
const blink = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  blink,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BLINK_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      cursorEl.style.opacity = Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Smooth character slice** (continuous typewriter — no pauses, no edits): faster to author but uniformly "machine-typed", missing the human realism:

```js
const fullText = "{fullPhrase}";
const len = { v: 0 };
tl.to(
  len,
  {
    v: fullText.length,
    duration: TYPE_DUR,
    ease: "power1.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = fullText.substring(0, Math.floor(len.v));
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

- **Thinking pause** — hold one state for `THINK_HOLD_DUR` (0.8–2.0s; under 0.5s reads as a stutter, not thought) simply by leaving a gap before the next entry's `t`.
- **State pulse on completion** — when the final state lands, `tl.to(".text", { scale: 1.03–1.08, duration: 0.15–0.3, yoyo: true, repeat: 1 }, T_DONE)`.
- **Per-state color shift** — in `onUpdate`, branch on `driver.t` vs the milestones: success color after `T_DONE`, dim mid-edit, normal while typing.

## Critical Constraints

- **Reverse-search the array each frame** — O(n) with small n (≤30 typical); don't index by frame, the sequence is sparse.
- **`min-width` on the text wrap is mandatory** — without it the right edge jitters as state length changes.
- **Discrete jumps must be INSTANT** — any transition on the text turns the jump into a smear and kills the "typing" feel.
- **Cursor blink is sin/sequence-driven on the timeline**, `display: inline-block`, monospace font, `white-space: nowrap` (wrapping mid-state breaks the illusion; trailing spaces must survive).
- **Discrete vs smooth** — use discrete only for non-linear states (typos, pauses, bulk paste); plain typing takes the smooth-slice variation.

# Dynamic Content Sequencing

A utility pattern (not a motion rule in itself) for scenes that show a SEQUENCE of items (cards, phrases, stats): each item's duration is computed from its content length + per-item config, and the sequencer assigns absolute start/end times automatically — no hardcoded offsets per item. Distinct from [discrete-text-sequence](discrete-text-sequence.md) (one text element changing states) — this rule swaps between distinct content blocks.

## How It Works

A content array of `{ eyebrow, title, body, speedFactor, hold }` entries is reduced once at build time into a flat `TIMELINE` of `{ …entry, start, end }` — duration per entry is `BASE_DURATION + body.length × SEC_PER_CHAR + hold`, so longer text earns more reading time. A single linear driver's `onUpdate` reverse-searches the active entry and swaps the DOM **only on transitions** (a `lastTitle` guard — per-frame `textContent` writes flicker in render); an optional progress bar fills 0→100% across the whole run.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="display">
  <div class="eyebrow" id="eyebrow"></div>
  <div class="title" id="title"></div>
  <div class="body" id="body"></div>
  <div class="progress-bar"><div class="progress-fill" id="progress-fill"></div></div>
</div>
```

```css
.body {
  min-height: 160px; /* reserve space — content height varies; without this, layout jumps */
}
.progress-fill {
  height: 100%;
  width: 0%;
}
```

```js
// N entries, each with its own pacing (optionally a speedFactor multiplier);
// the final entry uses a larger hold (closing beat).
const CONTENT = [
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrow1}", title: "{title1}", body: "{body1}", hold: HOLD_MID },
  // …
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrowN}", title: "{titleN}", body: "{bodyN}", hold: HOLD_FINAL },
];

// Pre-compute absolute start/end ONCE — never in onUpdate.
let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry) => {
  const dur = BASE_DURATION + entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR + entry.hold;
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});

function entryAt(time) {
  for (let i = TIMELINE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= TIMELINE[i].start) return TIMELINE[i];
  }
  return TIMELINE[0];
}

const eyebrowEl = document.getElementById("eyebrow");
const titleEl = document.getElementById("title");
const bodyEl = document.getElementById("body");
const progressEl = document.getElementById("progress-fill");

const TOTAL_DURATION = cumulative + TAIL_PAD;
const driver = { t: 0 };
let lastTitle = "";

tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const entry = entryAt(driver.t);
      // Swap content only on transitions — no per-frame DOM thrash
      if (entry.title !== lastTitle) {
        eyebrowEl.textContent = entry.eyebrow;
        titleEl.textContent = entry.title;
        bodyEl.textContent = entry.body;
        lastTitle = entry.title;
      }
      progressEl.style.width = `${(driver.t / TOTAL_DURATION) * 100}%`;
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Crossfade between items** — return BOTH adjacent entries during an overlap window (`time ≥ e.start − overlap && time ≤ e.end + overlap`, overlap ≈ 0.3s) and render them with opacities computed from distance to the boundary.
- **Per-item motion variation** — map an `entry.style` key to an existing rule per chapter (e.g. `3d-text-depth-layers` → `hacker-flip-3d` → `counting-dynamic-scale`); the sequencer only orchestrates timing.
- **Auto-extend composition duration** — you can set `data-duration` from the computed `TOTAL_DURATION` in script, but HF reads `data-duration` at composition load and setting it after init may not take effect — author the duration manually from a rough total.

### Accelerating cadence (geometric hold decay)

For rhetorical escalation — "everyone says…", a roll-call, a praise flurry — the beat grid itself accelerates: early entries hold ~1s (read speed), then windows shrink geometrically into a ~0.15–0.3s flurry, braking on an emphasis state before the resolve. The acceleration is pre-computed into the same flat `TIMELINE` — still content-driven, still deterministic, no speed-up tween anywhere:

```js
// Geometric decay on the hold, clamped at a flurry floor; the brake state holds longest.
const HOLDS = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => Math.max(FLURRY_FLOOR, HOLD_START * Math.pow(DECAY, i)));
HOLDS[CONTENT.length - 1] = HOLD_FINAL;

let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => {
  // Past ~0.5s states are glanced as motion texture, not read —
  // drop the per-char term or you never reach flurry speed.
  const readable = HOLDS[i] >= READ_THRESHOLD;
  const dur = HOLDS[i] + (readable ? entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR : 0);
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});
```

Worked example — **praise-chip flurry**: ~16 short quotes hard-cut through a chip beside a pinned wordmark. First 3 states at `HOLD_START = 1.0` (each reads fully); `DECAY = 0.8` shrinks every following window until `FLURRY_FLOOR = 0.2` catches it (≈12 states over ~2.5s — a churn of acclaim, individually glanced); the longest phrase takes `HOLD_FINAL ≈ 1.6` as the brake before the closing lockup.

Values: `HOLD_START` 0.8–1.2s; `DECAY` 0.75–0.88 (higher = longer runway before the flurry bites); `FLURRY_FLOOR` 0.15–0.3s (below ~0.15s swaps strobe); `READ_THRESHOLD` ~0.5s; brake ≥ 4× the floor or the stop doesn't register as a beat. The 3–6 entry guidance relaxes here — 12–18 states are legal precisely because flurry states aren't individually read. The hard-cut discipline (`lastTitle` guard, instant swaps) is what lets 0.2s states render clean.

## Values

| token         | range                 | notes                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BASE_DURATION | 0.6–1.5s              | minimum per entry regardless of length — even one-word entries get read time                                          |
| SEC_PER_CHAR  | 0.03–0.06 s/char      | ≈17–33 chars/sec; uniform across the sequence so the pace reads as one engine; lean high for wide-character languages |
| HOLD_MID      | 0.5–1.0s              | dwell on a non-final entry; `< HOLD_FINAL`                                                                            |
| HOLD_FINAL    | 1.0–2.0s              | climax dwell — must exceed HOLD_MID by a clear margin so the close reads as a beat                                    |
| SPEED_FACTOR  | 0.5–2.0 (default 1.0) | per-entry only; if every entry shares a factor, fold it into SEC_PER_CHAR                                             |
| TAIL_PAD      | 0.0–1.0s              | quiet beat after the last entry; prefer 0 when the next composition owns the breath                                   |
| CONTENT N     | 3–6 entries           | <3 isn't a sequence; >6 drags (accelerating cadence relaxes this — see above)                                         |

## Critical Constraints

- **Pre-compute the TIMELINE once at build** — never recompute in `onUpdate`; the reverse search over the flat array is the whole per-frame cost.
- **DOM swap only on entry transition** (`lastTitle`/key guard) — per-frame `textContent` assignment flickers in HF render.
- **`min-height` on the body element** — without reservation, downstream elements (progress bar, brand) jitter as content height varies.
- **Sequential only** — for parallel tracks use a different reduction.
- **Titles fit one line at the chosen size; bodies fit inside `min-height` after wrapping.**
